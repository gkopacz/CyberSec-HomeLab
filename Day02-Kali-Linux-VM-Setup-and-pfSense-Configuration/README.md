## üéØ Objective

Install **Kali Linux 2025.2** manually on Hyper-V, connect it to the lab‚Äôs LAN subnet, and access the **pfSense web GUI** to configure the initial firewall rules.  
This step brings the *attacker zone* online and initiates security policy enforcement within the lab environment.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Manual installation of **Kali Linux 2025.2** using ISO on Hyper-V  
- Hyper-V virtual hardware configuration (Gen2, UEFI, NIC assignment)  
- Integration of Kali VM with isolated lab subnet via internal switch  
- DHCP IP assignment validation via pfSense  
- Access and authentication to pfSense web GUI  
- Creation of initial firewall rules for segmentation and access control  

## üèóÔ∏è Setup Walkthrough

I started by heading over to the [official Kali Linux download page](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms) and selecting the **Installer Images** for the **x64 (Installer)** platform.

I chose to perform a **manual installation** using the full ISO. This method works both on bare metal and inside a guest virtual machine. It offers more control over system configuration and is great for showcasing OS installation and hardening skills.

> üí° If you're looking for a quicker setup, Kali also offers [pre-built VM images](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) for platforms like Hyper-V, VMware, and VirtualBox. These come preconfigured and optimized for virtualization ‚Äî perfect if you want to skip installation steps and get straight to lab work.

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive breakdown of the Day 02 setup, with a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep walkthrough of the entire Kali VM installation process.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating the Virtual Machine in Hyper‚ÄëV

I created a new virtual machine in **Hyper‚ÄëV Manager** using the following configuration:

| Setting    | Value                          |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| **Name**   | Kali Linux                      |
| **Generation** | Gen 2 (UEFI, Secure Boot disabled) |
| **CPU**    | 2 vCPU                          |
| **Memory** | 4 GB (Dynamic)                  |
| **Disk**   | 50 GB (Dynamically Expanding)   |
| **Network**| Internal switch (LAN subnet)    |

> üí° I chose **Generation 2** for UEFI support and modern hardware emulation. Make sure to disable **Secure Boot**, as Kali doesn‚Äôt support the default Microsoft boot keys.

Once the VM was created, I attached the **Kali Linux 2025.2 ISO** to the virtual DVD drive and adjusted the boot order so the system would boot directly into the installer.

## üì• ISO Boot & Graphical Install

I mounted the **kali-linux-2025.2-installer-amd64.iso** and launched into the **Graphical install** mode:
