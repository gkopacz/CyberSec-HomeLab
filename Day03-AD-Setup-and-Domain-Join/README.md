## üéØ Objective

Deploy a **Windows Server 2019** VM in the `AD` subnet and promote it to a **Domain Controller**. Set up **Active Directory**, configure **DNS**, and enable **DHCP** for the subnet. Join Windows clients to the new domain to validate identity management and directory-based authentication. This lays the foundation for centralized access control, Group Policy testing, and future detection engineering scenarios.


## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Deployment of **Windows Server 2019** on Hyper-V with Gen 2 settings  
- Promotion of standalone server to **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**  
- Configuration of **DNS Server** for internal name resolution  
- (Optional) Setup of **DHCP Server** for automated IP assignment in the AD zone  
- Creation of an **Active Directory forest and domain** (e.g., `adlab.local`)  
- Domain join of Windows 10 and 11 clients and login validation  
- Basic troubleshooting of domain-related connectivity and authentication issues

# üõ†Ô∏è Setup Walkthrough

The Windows Server 2019 machine will serve as the backbone of the Active Directory (AD) zone in my lab. Deployed as a virtual machine on Hyper-V, it will be promoted to a Domain Controller, provide DNS and DHCP (for the AD subnet), and eventually manage user/group policies and domain authentication for Windows clients.

I started by downloading the Windows Server 2019 ISO from the official Microsoft Evaluation Center: üîó [Download Windows Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Windows Server VM

In **Hyper-V Manager**, I created a new Gen 2 virtual machine:

| Setting       | Value                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| **Name**      | DC01-WinServer2019              |
| **Generation**| Gen 2 (UEFI, Secure Boot off)   |
| **CPU**       | 2 vCPU                          |
| **Memory**    | 4 GB (Dynamic)                  |
| **Disk**      | 60 GB (Dynamically Expanding)   |
| **NIC**       | Internal switch (AD subnet)     |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Windows Server 2019

I mounted the **Windows Server 2019 ISO** in the virtual DVD drive of the Hyper‚ÄëV VM and powered it on.  

To ensure a smooth install, I reviewed and adjusted the **boot order** in the VM settings:

1. **DVD Drive** (for ISO boot)
2. **Hard Drive** (for post-install boots)
3. **Network Adapter** (PXE boot ‚Äî left last)

> üí° Setting the correct boot sequence avoids boot loops and ensures the OS installer launches on first boot.

Once installation is complete, I‚Äôll remove the **DVD drive** from the VM to prevent accidental reboots into the installer.

### üó£Ô∏è Language & Keyboard

Selected the default options:

  * Language: English (United States)
  * Time and currency: English (United States)
  * Keyboard: US

### üì¶ Choose Edition

During setup, I was prompted to select the Windows Server edition. I went with:

> **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter Evaluation (Desktop Experience)**

![Choose Edition](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-OS-version.png)

Why Datacenter?

- It's better optimized for **Hyper-V environments**.
- It includes advanced features like **Shielded VMs**, **Storage Spaces Direct**, and **Software-Defined Networking**, which may come in handy in future lab phases.

For a homelab, either edition works ‚Äî but Datacenter ensures maximum compatibility with virtualization tasks and gives you flexibility down the line.

> üìö Microsoft provides a full breakdown of **Standard vs Datacenter** features [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/editions-comparison?pivots=windows-server-2019&tabs=full-comparison).

### üîß Install Type

I selected **Custom: Install Windows only (Advanced)** to perform a clean, manual installation.

This option allowed me to partition the virtual disk from scratch and ensured no pre-installed roles or features were added ‚Äî ideal for a domain controller build where I want full control over each configuration step.

### üíΩ Disk Partition

During setup, I clicked **New** and allocated the entire **60 GB** of virtual disk space to a single **primary partition**, then hit **Apply**.

![Disk_Partition_size](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-Disk-Partition.png)

Once the partition table was created, I selected the primary partition and continued with installation.

![Disk_Partition](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-Disk-Partition-done.png)

### üîë Administrator Password Setup

After installation completed, I was prompted to set a password for the **built-in Administrator** account.

I chose a strong, complex password that meets Active Directory best practices.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Network Configuration

After logging in to the newly installed **Windows Server 2019** VM, I launched **Server Manager** to perform initial configuration steps.

### üñ•Ô∏è Rename the Host

By default, Windows assigns a random hostname. I renamed it to something meaningful:

- **Old Name:** WIN-XXXXXXXXXX  
- **New Name:** `DC01`

To rename the server, I opened Server Manager, clicked on Local Server, and selected the Computer Name field. From there, I hit Change, entered `DC01` as the new name, and rebooted when prompted.

![Hostname](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-hostname.png)

### üåê Configure Static IP Address

Since I planned to handle DHCP at the Windows Server level, I didn‚Äôt configure DHCP on pfSense for the AD subnet. Instead, I manually assigned a static IP address to the domain controller during initial setup to ensure stability for DNS and future domain operations.

Steps:
1. Go to **Control Panel** ‚Üí **Network and Sharing Center**
2. Click **Change adapter settings**
3. Right-click **Ethernet adapter** ‚Üí **Properties**
4. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** ‚Üí **Properties**
5. Configure:
   - IP Address: `10.0.3.9`
   - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
   - Default Gateway: `10.0.3.1` 
   - Preferred DNS: `10.0.3.9` (this server will run DNS after domain promotion)

![IP_Address](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-static-ip.png)

> üí° Assigning a static IP ensures domain services remain accessible and clients can reliably resolve and contact the domain controller.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install AD DS, DNS & DHCP Roles

I launched **Server Manager**, then navigated to:

**Start Menu** ‚Üí **Server Manager** ‚Üí **Manage** ‚Üí **Add Roles and Features**

From there, I followed these steps:

1. **Installation Type:** Chose `Role-based or feature-based installation` and clicked **Next**
2. **Server Selection:** Confirmed `Select a server from the server pool` was selected ‚Äî my server (`DC01`) was auto-selected
3. **Server Roles:** Enabled the following:
   - **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
   - **DNS Server**
   - **DHCP Server**
  
![Server_Roles](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-server-roles.png)

> üí° This preps the server with the necessary components to become a fully functional **Domain Controller**.

### üè∞ Promote the Server to Domain Controller

Once the roles were installed, I went back to **Server Manager** and clicked the **flag icon** in the top-right corner. From there, I selected **Promote this server to a domain controller**.

Here‚Äôs how I handled the wizard:

### üß± **Deployment Configuration:**  

   Selected `Add a new forest` and set the **root domain name** to `adlab.local`

![Server_Roles](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-promote-dc.png)

### üîê **Domain Controller Options:**  

   Kept the default selections (Domain Name System (DNS) server, Global Catalog, etc.)  
   Set a strong **DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode)** password

![Server_Roles](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-dsrm-pwd.png)

### üß≠ **DNS Options:**  

   Left everything as default and hit **Next**

### üìÇ **Additional Pages:**  

   Accepted the default **NetBIOS name**, **paths**, and skipped any extra configuration

### ‚úÖ **Prerequisites Check:**  

   Waited for the check to complete successfully, then clicked **Install**

![Server_Roles](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-pre-check.png)

> üí° After completing the wizard, the system automatically rebooted. Once it came back online, the server was now an official **Domain Controller** for `adlab.local`.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure DNS on the Domain Controller

After the domain controller promotion, the DNS Server role was already installed and active.

To make sure DNS name resolution works beyond the domain (e.g. internet access), I configured DNS Forwarders to point upstream to the pfSense gateway.

### üì° Why Use Forwarders Instead of Forward Lookup Zones

In this setup, my Domain Controller already hosts the `adlab.local` **Forward Lookup Zone**, which handles internal name resolution (e.g. `dc01.adlab.local`).

However, it can‚Äôt resolve **external DNS queries** (like `github.com` or `kali.org`) unless I configure it to forward those requests.

That‚Äôs why I used the **Forwarders tab** ‚Äî to point the DC‚Äôs DNS to pfSense (`10.0.3.1`) as its upstream resolver. From there, pfSense can resolve external domains on behalf of the internal network.

| Feature              | **Forwarders**                                                                                       | **Forward Lookup Zones**                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Forwards queries your DNS server can't resolve locally to another DNS server (like `10.0.3.1`).      | Stores domain-to-IP mappings your DNS server manages directly.                           |
| **Use Case**         | When you want your DC to forward unresolved DNS queries (e.g., external domains) to an upstream DNS. | When you want your DC to host and manage records for internal domains (e.g., `adlab.local`). |
| **Example**          | `google.com` not found locally ‚Üí forward to pfSense ‚Üí pfSense resolves it.                           | You create records for `labvm01.adlab.local`, etc.                                        |

> üß† Think of **Forwarders** as a ‚Äúfallback route‚Äù for DNS ‚Äî when your DC doesn‚Äôt know an answer, it asks pfSense.

### üß≠ Configuration Steps

I launched **Server Manager**, clicked **Tools** ‚Üí **DNS** to open the DNS Manager console.

Inside **DNS Manager**:
- I expanded the tree and right-clicked my domain controller (`DC01`)
- Selected **Properties**
- Navigated to the **Forwarders** tab

There, I:
- Clicked **Edit**
- Added my pfSense LAN IP: `10.0.3.1`
- Clicked **OK** to save the configuration

![DNS](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/AD-VM/WinSrv-dns.png)

> üí° Without this, internal clients could resolve only domain names (e.g., adlab.local) but wouldn‚Äôt be able to browse the web or resolve public domains like microsoft.com, which is critical for things like Windows Updates and pulling packages.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Configure DHCP on DC

- Create a new IPv4 scope in **DHCP Manager**
- Define IP range (e.g., `10.0.2.100 - 10.0.2.200`)
- Set DNS server to `10.0.2.1` (DC IP)
- Activate scope

> üí° On pfSense: make sure DHCP is disabled for the AD interface to avoid conflict

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Windows Client Setup & Domain Join

I spun up a **Windows 10 Pro** VM in Hyper-V:

- Assigned NIC to the AD internal switch
- Installed updates & renamed machine
- Opened `System Properties` ‚Üí `Domain Join`
- Joined `adlab.local` using AD credentials
- Rebooted and logged in as domain user

## ‚úÖ Validation

- `ipconfig /all` shows DNS = DC IP
- `ping dc.adlab.local` resolves successfully
- Logged in with domain credentials
- Accessed `Active Directory Users & Computers`
- Created test user & OU structure

## üîú Next Step

On Day 04, I‚Äôll configure Splunk and begin sending Windows logs from the DC and clients. This will kick off the **detection engineering** and centralized monitoring phase of the HomeLab.
