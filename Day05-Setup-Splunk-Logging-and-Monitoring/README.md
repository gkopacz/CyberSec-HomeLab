## üéØ Objective

With the domain infrastructure and endpoints deployed, the next core component is **centralized log visibility**. This phase focuses on provisioning a clean Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS virtual machine in the **Monitoring subnet**, preparing it with essential tools, and laying the foundation for deploying **Splunk Enterprise** as the lab‚Äôs primary SIEM. This system will collect logs from domain controllers, clients, and network devices, enabling full-stack monitoring and future detection engineering.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Provisioned and installed Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS as a dedicated SIEM host
- Installed and configured **Splunk Enterprise** on Linux
- Deployed **Splunk Universal Forwarders** on Windows endpoints (DC + clients)
- Enabled forwarding of Security, System, and PowerShell logs to Splunk
- Installed and configured **Sysmon** for enriched endpoint telemetry
- Ingested and verified firewall logs from **pfSense** via remote syslog
- Validated log flows using **SPL queries** and Splunk dashboards
- Hardened visibility pipeline for future detection engineering use

# üõ†Ô∏è Setup Walkthrough

Provisioned a dedicated VM using Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS and installed **Splunk Enterprise 9.4.3** to act as the lab‚Äôs centralized SIEM. Deployed the **Splunk Universal Forwarder** to the Domain Controller and Windows clients, then successfully ingested event logs into Splunk. Also configured **pfSense firewall log forwarding** to capture network-level telemetry alongside endpoint events.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ubuntu Host VM Setup

### üêß Download Ubuntu ISO

I downloaded the latest **Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS** desktop ISO directly from Canonical‚Äôs website: üîó [Download Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)

### üíª Ubuntu VM Configuration

To serve as the **centralized monitoring node**, I spun up an Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS virtual machine within the Monitoring subnet using Hyper-V.

| **Setting**  | **Value**                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Name         | SPLUNK                        |
| Generation   | Gen 2                         |
| CPU          | 2 vCPU                        |
| Memory       | 4 GB (Dynamic)                |
| Disk         | 80 GB (Dynamically Expanding) |
| Network      | Internal Switch (Monitoring)  |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Ubuntu on the VM

Once the VM was created and the ISO mounted, I proceeded with the installation of Ubuntu. From the GRUB boot menu, I selected **Try or Install Ubuntu**.

### üåç Language, Accessibility & Keyboard

I selected the following from the guided interactive installer.

- Selected **English** as the system language.
- Skipped accessibility options.
- Set keyboard layout to **English (US)** for both layout and variant.

### üåê Network Settings

Selected **wired connection** to ensure full update and driver access during install.

### üíø Install Type & Mode

Chose to **Install Ubuntu** (not ‚ÄúTry Ubuntu‚Äù), followed by **Interactive installation** for manual control over packages and disk config.

![Ubuntu_Install](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/Interactive.png)

### üë§ User & Host Setup

Created the user `g0bl1n` and named the machine `VM-Splunk`. Ensured password was required at login.

![Ubuntu_user](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/Account.png)

### üíΩ Disk Configuration

Opted for **Erase disk and install Ubuntu**, perfect for a dedicated lab VM. No encryption was configured.

This automatically set up `/boot/efi` and `/` partitions using fat32 and EXT4.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Install Prep for Splunk

After rebooting into the newly installed Ubuntu system, I logged in and performed essential prep steps to ready the box for **Splunk Enterprise** installation.

### üì¶ System Updates & Basic Tools

I updated all packages and installed basic dependencies using:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install wget curl net-tools -y
```

![Ubuntu_apt](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/apt_update.png)

### üì° IP Address Management

Instead of setting a static IP manually on the Ubuntu host, I configured a **static DHCP lease** in **pfSense** to ensure the VM always receives the same IP address based on its MAC.

![Ubuntu_ifconfig](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/ip_ifconfig.png)

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Splunk Enterprise on VM

With the Ubuntu VM fully configured and network-ready, I proceeded to install **Splunk Enterprise**.

I navigated to the [Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html) web interface on my Ubuntu VM. 

I filled in the details, accepted the license agreement, and clicked **Create Account** to complete the setup.

![Splunk_details](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/Splunk_details.png)

### üíæ Download Splunk Enterprise

After receiving the verification email, I confirmed my account to unlock the Splunk Enterprise download link. 

Next, I selected the Linux `.deb` package for 64-bit systems and copied the `wget` link.

![Splunk_download](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_download_deb.png)

I pasted the `wget` command into the terminal, which downloaded the `.deb` installer directly to my home directory.

![Splunk_wget](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_wget.png)

### üì¶ Install Splunk Enterprise

Then I ran the following command to install Splunk:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i splunk-10.0.0-e8eb0c4654f8-linux-amd64.deb
```

![Splunk_dpkg](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_dpkg_install.png)

### üîå Start Splunk Enterprise

Once installed, I navigated to the Splunk bin directory and started it with license acceptance:

```bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
sudo ./splunk start --accept-license --accept-yes
```
![Splunk_start](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_set_admin.png)

On first run it prompted me to create an admin user, but after completing the setup I encountered an issue where the web interface on port `8000` was unreachable.

![Splunk_error](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_error.png)

So I started troubleshooting.

### ‚ùå Symptoms

- Splunk CLI showed: `"web interface does not seem to be available!"`
- `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000` failed
- No response when accessing `http://<hostname>:8000` from the browser

### ‚úÖ Fix 

Restarted Splunk.

```bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
sudo ./splunk restart
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Configure Splunk to Start at Boot

After Splunk restarted successfully, I configured it to start automatically at boot.

```bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
sudo ./splunk enable boot-start
```

![Splunk_boot](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_start@boot.png)

### üåê Enable Receiving Data on Port 9997

I logged into the Splunk web interface using the admin credentials I created earlier:

![Splunk_login](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_login.png)

From the top menu, I navigated to: `Settings ‚Üí Forwarding and receiving`

![Splunk_set_fwd](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_set_fwd.png)

On the `Forwarding and receiving` page, under the `Receive data` section, I clicked `+ Add new` to configure this Splunk instance to accept logs from forwarders.

![Splunk_receive_data](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/Splunk/splunk_receive_data.png)

I configured the listener to use TCP port `9997` and clicked **Save**.
