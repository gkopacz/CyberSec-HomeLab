## üéØ Objective

Set up the virtual network infrastructure using **Hyper-V** and deploy **pfSense Community Edition 2.7.2** as the core firewall to control and segment traffic between lab environments. This network layer acts as the backbone for all connectivity and security enforcement in the HomeLab. (Note: pfSense CE 2.8.0 was released after this setup. An upgrade will follow after the lab foundation is complete.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Completed

- Created and configured 5 virtual switches in Hyper-V
- Installed pfSense in a VM with 5 NICs 
- Assigned interfaces and verified connectivity
- Configured basic firewall rules and access from the host network
- Documented the setup process with screenshots and architecture diagram

## üèóÔ∏è Setup Walkthrough

This lab runs on a **Hyper-V** virtualization platform and includes multiple **virtual machines (VMs)**, **isolated virtual switches**, and a virtualized **pfSense firewall/router** that controls traffic and enforces segmentation between networks.

To visualize the setup, I created the following network diagram:

---

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive breakdown of the lab components and a step‚Äëby‚Äëstep walkthrough of the entire setup process.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Internet & Host PC

The **home router** connects to the internet and provides outbound access. The **Host PC** runs **Hyper-V**, serving as the base virtualization platform where all virtual machines and virtual switches reside.

> üí°  I ensured virtualization was enabled in the BIOS before starting. I preferred Hyper-V over VMware or VirtualBox because of its seamless integration with Windows and better resource management on my setup.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Switches and Subnets

The network setup begins with creating **virtual switches** in Hyper-V, which form the segmented subnets of the lab. These provide isolation and simulate real-world network zones.

| Name               | Type     | Purpose                              |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| WAN                | External | pfSense WAN (internet access)        |
| LAN                | Internal | Kali Linux / attacker VM             |
| Monitoring         | Internal | Splunk & logging VM network          |
| AD                 | Internal | Hosts Active Directory & Windows VMs |
| Vulnerable Machines| Internal | Vulnerable machine subnet            |

#### üåê Virtual Switch - WAN

This **external switch** connects pfSense to the home router, enabling internet access. It's configured in Hyper-V as an *External* type.

> üí° I created separate virtual switches for each subnet by opening Hyper-V Manager on the host PC and using the Virtual Switch Manager under the Actions tab.

#### üîí Virtual Switch - LAN

This **internal switch** connects the Kali Linux VM (10.0.1.47). I created the remaining subnets using internal switches following the same process.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ pfSense Firewall and Router

The **pfSense firewall** serves as the central hub for routing and security within the homelab environment. Deployed as a virtual machine on **Hyper-V**, it manages traffic between the WAN and multiple internal subnets, ensuring network segmentation and control.

I started by downloading the latest pfSense ISO image from the [official website](https://www.pfsense.org/download/). <br>

At the time of setup, the current release was pfSense CE 2.7.2, as shown in the screenshot below. Since then, version 2.8.0 has been released.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For new users following this guide, I recommend downloading the latest stable version available. I'll upgrade to 2.8.0 after completing the initial lab configuration.

![pfSense_ISO](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/download-pfSense-firewall-iso-image.png)

I created the **pfSense** virtual machine inside Hyper-V using the following specifications. <br>

> üí° I chose Generation 2 to support UEFI boot and modern compatibility. Secure Boot must be disabled for pfSense to boot properly.

| Setting           | Value                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Name**          | pfSense                        |
| **Generation**    | Generation 2                   |
| **CPU**           | 2 vCPU                         |
| **Memory**        | 4 GB (Dynamic)                 |
| **Storage**       | 40 GB (Dynamically allocated)  |
| **Boot Firmware** | UEFI (Secure Boot disabled)    |
| **Network Adapters** | 1 (initially) ‚Äî WAN         |

After creating the VM:
- I disabled **Secure Boot**
- Set the **boot order** (as seen below)
- Added the remaining **network adapters** for LAN and internal subnets

![pfSense_Settings](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/pfSense-VM-Settings.png)

Upon first boot, pfSense walks through installation and disk partitioning. I selected the following options:

- `Auto (ZFS)` ‚Äî Guided Root-on-ZFS
- `Stripe` ‚Äî No Redundancy (no mirroring or RAID)

After the installation and reboot, pfSense prompts for interface assignments.

> üí° When prompted to set up VLANs, I selected `n` since I'm using separate virtual switches to isolate traffic instead of VLAN tagging.

Next, I manually assigned the following interfaces:

- `hn0` ‚Üí WAN  
- `hn1` ‚Üí LAN  
- `hn2` ‚Üí OPT1 (Monitoring)  
- `hn3` ‚Üí OPT2 (AD)  
- `hn4` ‚Üí OPT3 (Vulnerable Machines)

![pfSense_interfaces](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/pfSense-interface-config.png)

Each interface was configured with a static IP address appropriate for its subnet.  
The **WAN interface** received an IP address automatically from my home router (via DHCP).  
The **LAN interface** was initially assigned the default IP: `192.168.1.1/24`, while the remaining interfaces were unconfigured at this stage.

I selected option `2` from the pfSense menu to begin interface configuration:

![pfSense_LAN_Setup](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/pfSense-LAN-setup.png)

I then selected the **LAN** interface and configured it as follows:

- Configure IPv4 address for LAN via DHCP? ‚Üí `n`
- Enter the new LAN IPv4 address ‚Üí `10.0.1.1`
- Enter the new LAN IPv4 subnet bit count ‚Üí `24`

> üí° I pressed Enter when prompted for an upstream gateway, since LAN traffic should stay isolated and routed through pfSense.

![pfSense_LAN_interface](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/pfSense-LAN-interface.png)

I continued with the LAN configuration:

- Configure IPv6 address for LAN via DHCP6? ‚Üí `n`
- For the new LAN IPv6 address prompt ‚Üí *press* `Enter`
- Enable DHCP server on LAN? ‚Üí `y`
- Start of IPv4 client address range ‚Üí `10.0.1.100`
- End of IPv4 client address range ‚Üí `10.0.1.200`
- Revert to HTTP for webConfigurator? ‚Üí `n`

![pfSense_LAN_interface_DHCP](https://github.com/gkopacz/CyberSec-HomeLab/blob/main/images/pfSense-LAN-interface-dhcp.png)

I followed the same process for the **Monitoring** and **Vulnerable Machines** interfaces.

> üí° The only difference for the **AD** interface is that I did **not** enable DHCP. The **Active Directory Domain Controller** will handle IP assignments in that subnet.

Here‚Äôs what the final interface configuration looked like:
