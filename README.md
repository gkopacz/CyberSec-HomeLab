## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a **cybersecurity homelab** tailored for learning, testing, and experimenting in cybersecurity, networking, and system administration, while ensuring a secure and isolated environment.

## 🧠 Skills Showcased

### 🖥️ Virtualization 
* Proficient in setting up and managing virtual machines using **Hyper-V**.
* Optimized VM performance through effective allocation of **CPU, memory, and storage**.
  
### 🌐 Networking 
* **Subnetting**: Designed and deployed multiple subnets.
* **Routing**: Configured **pfSense** to route traffic between subnets and external networks.
* **Firewall Management**: Defined firewall rules to control traffic flow and ensure segmentation.
* **Network Isolation**: Achieved secure communication using isolated virtual switches.

### 🧑‍💻 System Administration 
* Installed and managed **Windows Server 2019**, Windows 10 clients, and **Linux** machines.
* Configured **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**:
  * Set up a Domain Controller.
  * Managed users, groups, and permissions.
  * Deployed **DNS** and **AD Certificate Services**.
  * Joined client machines to the domain.

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
* Built a dedicated **monitoring VM** for:
  * Network traffic analysis
  * Log collection
  * System health monitoring
* Installed and configured **Splunk Enterprise** for log ingestion and alerting.
  
### 📝 Documentation and Design
* Created a detailed **network architecture diagram** using **Microsoft Visio**.
* Documented the entire setup process to enable easy replication.
